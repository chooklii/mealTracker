# mealTracker 

What is this?

- This is a React App with Express Backend used to track all of your meals. Add meals and data about them, if you eat a meal klick "eat" and the app will recommend you meals you have not eaten in a long time. 

Note: The Design of this Project is only optimised for mobile-phones, it works on Desktop as well but can look a bit strange at times.
